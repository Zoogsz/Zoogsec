# Intro

[https://pwn.college/](https://pwn.college/)  is a completely free education platform by ASU focused on finding/exploiting vulnerabilities in software. It has an absolutely grueling number of challenges but is well worth the time.

The level's are categorized as "belts" and are as listed below (Solutions will be linked as I write them)

If you are here for answers go home. Genuinely, the struggle is worth it.
